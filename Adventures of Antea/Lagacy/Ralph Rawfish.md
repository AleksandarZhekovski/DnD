Coming from a rather small village on the north-most coast of mainland Antea Ralph 
enjoyed a happy childhood, being the second and only surviving child of dad_name and 
mom_name Rawfish. The Rawfish family had been fishermen for as long as they 
could remember and every surviving record in the village very much said the same. 
dad_name and mom_name met on the shore, got married on the shore and 
build a house on the shore, after a heavy storm crumbled dad_name's inherited one.
Their first child, Eve, died at 10 years of age, shortly after Ralph's birth and so he
never got to know much as his parents seldom talked of that terrible time. Most 
everything he knew about her was from other villagers speaking at great length 
how wonderful, pretty, helpful and reliable she was even at young age. Most 
people in the village compared Ralph to his sister often and he never got to 
completely escape her shadow, despite working hard and achieving most of her 
feats, the village had already idolized Eve and he would always come second.

And well, Ralph did have a flaw, for all his work and effort in whatever he was 
assigned to do, he could never choose a purpose for himself, or chose anything 
for that matter. Every decision, minor or major, was like a petrifying spell cast upon him.
For his 9th birthday, dad_name gave Ralph a ch between a new shirt or a new hat. 
Ralph fell ill for week, unable to decide. In the end, the money dad_name
had saved for the present went towards medicine from the local apothecary, 
but breaking the news that there would be no present seemed to have a 
much greater effect on his well being then the medicine. For his 12th, dad_name 
rather cautiously suggested that the present could be a hat or a different hat, 
not naming anything in particular, very quickly retracted the question seeing his son 
sitting down and thinking about for 4 hours strait. Ralph's inability chose anything 
become a running joke with his family and the village. People would often suggest 
a pointless ultimatum to him and have a quick chuckle at his troubled expression, 
then quickly retract the question. Over the years poor Ralph did manage to build 
some tolerance, but even decisions of medium importance could send him down 
a spiral. 

It all changed around his 19th birthday when his father met a very elderly 
traveling artificer. The story of Ralph "the Decisive", as the village had started 
to jokingly call him, captured the artificer's attention and seeing a problem that 
could be solved by a trinket, quickly devised a rather unique solution. Using all his 
knowledge and skill the man created a tiny circular device that could be strapped 
to ones wrist and a press of a small lever would spin a pick attached to the center
of the device. Behind the the pick there was a plate, meticulously divided with lines 
and colors in different zones as to allow the pick to make a number random selections, 
ranging from yes or no to 1 in 12. This changed everything for Ralph and the device 
practically became an extension of his wrist and of himself. The artificer was incredibly 
proud of his creation and refused any sort of payment or gift from dad_name, stating 
that the pure happiness and joy his work brought to that little boy was all the 
compensation he needed. He even thought Ralph to maintain and repair the device 
should the need arise. Having extended his stay significantly longer then expected 
the man left the village to continue his travels and Ralph never saw him again but never 
forgot the kindness that a total stranger did for him. 

Ralph's little village saw an usually big priestly activity for a settlement of that size.
unbenounced to the commoners the local church had an impressive collection of
holy and scholarly texts and many priests and clerics traveled from far to seek
knowledge and enlightenment. One of the head record keepers was great friends
with dad_name's late father and and stayed very close with family even after his
friend's passing. Clarence was his name and it is he who inspired a great admiration
for the gods in Ralph. The elderly scholar would often tell Ralph about the great gods
and he quickly noticed Ralph's affinity for the gods of law and order. As time went on
and Ralph learned to read and write, Clarence begun to bring holy scripts, scholarly
text or even mundane legal documents as Ralph simply devoured everything and 
most especially things about law. A few years after the occurrence with the traveling
artificer, Clarence suggested to Ralph that he come study at the church and that day
fate moved the pick of Ralph device to point towards yes.

Ralph's time at the church was short. He was quite a bit older then most recruits 
and most importantly already knew to read and write. Very quickly he learned 
most of what the teacher-priests had to teach and none could satisfy his thirst 
for anything to do with law. Ralph adored the rigid structure of legislation and how
it left little to the whimsical decisions of one singular person. Yearning for more and
with significant help from Clarence, Ralph manged to get a position as a priestly 
scholar in the largest city in the northern plateau. But there he faced a bitter truth.
What he thought would be a utopian locus of law and society turned out to be a 
nightmare. People in power would often bend and twist to law and sometimes even
completely disregard it. There was poverty, starvation and mass misery all throughout
the town. Criminal syndicates basically run everything and had most officials on 
payroll, if the officials in question weren't the ones leading the syndicates in the first 
place. Ralph manged to survive there for 3 years. In the end, after objecting to the 
illegal actives of the syndicates one time too many, they turned their attention to him
and put him on The Blacklist. The Blacklist was a way of rooting out problematic 
individuals within the town. Everyone on it was almost instantly accused of several
high profile crimes and evidence proving their guild would appear seemingly of thin air. 
A high reward bounty followed. 

Forced to flea, Ralph started making his way back home very quietly and slowly. Fliers
with his portrait could be seen miles away from the town and staying under shadow 
proved to be very difficult. He had more the one close encounters, but the closer he
got to his home, the easier it became. Finally stepping to the top of the hill that served 
as entrance to the village he saw the sea and the church standing tall to the side and 
the main square with the fountain and lastly his eyes drifted toward his house. It was all
burned, and wasted, and leveled to the ground. Some remains still burned, some had 
noting left to kindle. Even from far, blood could be easily spotted everywhere, as if it was
purposefully painted on the streets to make a statement. 

Ralph stood on that hill for hours, his eyes wondered all around, his thoughts even more.
He asking himself countless questions and conceived dozen answers to each, yet he 
reached no explanation. Yes the government found out his birthplace, it was on multitude
of document. Yes they came to look for him here, it was obvious that's where he would go. 
Yes they interrogated and tortured the townsfolk, assuming that they hid him or at least 
knew of his whereabouts. Yes they searched and rampaged all houses, there might be 
hidden basements or floor holes. Yes failing to find anything they decided to complete 
the rest of the order to kill everyone and burn the village to make an example to everyone
who would dare defy the corrupt ruling class. It all seemed so clear and obvious now, but 
still completely explainable. Undefinable. Out of pure muscle memory, faced with the 
inability to make a verdict he pulled the lever of his device. It landed on "no", "no what" 
he asked out loud and pulled again. "no". He pulled once more. "no". For reasons that 
Ralph never manged to explain this calmed and relaxed him. Tears rolled down his face 
as he tried to hide it. He mumbled "I should've been here to defend them" and kept
wiping tears, but caught a slight glance at his wrist. The pick had moved towards "Yes".
After a minute he stood up, wiped the last drops off his cheeks and reached towards 
the tiny lever again, looked up to the skies and ask: "Where to now". As the pick 
was spinning he held his arm out strait and when he felt it stopped he looked 
and it pointed east. 

The next 15 years saw Ralph travel all around the continent and islands helping whoever
he met, however he could. He saw many wonderful and horrible things and defied the 
government everywhere he could. Throughout the long journey he met hundreds of people,
had had many companions, yet none of them where quite as intriguing as the ones he would 
meet at a little tavern today.
