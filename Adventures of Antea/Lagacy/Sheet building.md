Cleric, Domain of Order, Ruined background

Prof mod is determined by level, at lever 1 cleric gets +2 

I chose my base stats and then added 1 cuz human. Then for ability mod: (overall - 10) / 2 

|     | base | human | overall | abl mod |
| --- | ---- | ----- | ------- | ------- |
| str | 13   | +1    | 14      | +2      |
| dex | 8    | +1    | 9       | -1      |
| con | 14   | +1    | 15      | +2      |
| int | 10   | +1    | 11      | 0       |
| wis | 15   | +1    | 16      | +3      |
| chr | 12   | +1    | 13      | +1      |

Saving trows, just the ability mod plus prof bonus for ones I am prof in

|     | base | prof | overall |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ------- |
| str | 2    |      | 2       |
| dex | -1   |      | -1      |
