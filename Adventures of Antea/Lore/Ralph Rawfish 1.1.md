Coming from Krowvill, a rather small human village on the north-most coast of mainland
Antea, Ralph was the second child of Maria and Martin Rawfish. Everyone in the village 
knew that the Rawfish family had been fishermen for generations and generations and 
very good ones at that. Maria and Martin met on the shore, worked on the shore, 
married on the shore and build a house on the shore. The sea was all they knew, and
all they needed for it gave them everything to build family. Their first child, Evelyn, 
was born in the height of summer and carried the spirit of her birth season. With her 
sunny smile and ever present cheerfulness she was loved by everyone in Krowvill. 
3 mounts after her 9th birthday and mere days after Ralph's birth, Evelyn disappeared.
Her torn, bloody clothes were later found on a beach not too far from the village, but no 
body was ever uncovered. 

Ralph's childhood was comfortable. The winters were soft, or at least a soft as they can 
get so far up north and the summers were plentiful. Most everything he knew about Eve 
was from other villagers speaking at great length how wonderful, pretty, helpful and 
reliable she was even at young age. People in the village compared Ralph to his sister 
often and he never got to completely escape her shadow, despite working hard and
achieving most of her feats, the village had already idolized Eve and he would 
always come second.

And well, Ralph did have a flaw, for all his work and effort in whatever he was 
assigned to do, he could never choose a purpose for himself, or chose anything 
for that matter. Every decision, minor or major, was like a petrifying spell cast upon him.
For his 9th birthday, Martin gave Ralph a choice between a new shirt or a new hat. 
Ralph, unable to decide, fell ill for week. In the end, the money Martin
had saved for the present went towards medicine from the local apothecary, 
but breaking the news that there would be no present seemed to have a 
much greater effect on his well being then the medicine. For his 12th, he dad, 
rather cautiously, suggested that the present could be a hat or a different hat, 
not naming anything in particular, very quickly retracted the question seeing his son 
sitting down and think about it for 4 hours strait. Ralph's inability chose anything 
become a running joke with his family and the village. People would often suggest 
a pointless ultimatum to him and have a chuckle at his troubled expression, 
then quickly retract the question. Over the years poor Ralph did manage to build 
some tolerance, but even decisions of medium importance could send him down 
a spiral.

It all changed around his 17th birthday when his father met a very elderly 
traveling artificer. The story of Ralph "the Decisive", as the village had started 
to jokingly call him, captured the artificer's attention and seeing a problem that 
could be solved by a trinket, quickly devised a rather unique solution. Using all his 
knowledge and skill the man created a tiny circular device that could be strapped 
to ones wrist and a press of a small lever would spin a pick attached to the center
of the device. Behind the the pick there was a plate, meticulously divided with lines 
and colors in different zones as to allow the pick to make a number random selections, 
ranging from yes or no to 1 in 12. This changed everything for Ralph and the device 
practically became an extension of his wrist and of himself. The artificer was incredibly 
proud of his creation and refused any sort of payment or gift from Martin, stating 
that the pure happiness and joy his work brought to that little boy was all the 
compensation he claimed to need. He even thought Ralph to maintain and repair the device 
should the need arise. Having extended his stay significantly longer then expected 
the man left the village to continue his travels and Ralph never saw him again, but never 
forgot the kindness that a total stranger did for him. 

Ralph's little village saw an usually big priestly activity for a settlement of that size.
unbenounced to the commoners the local church had an impressive collection of
holy and scholarly texts and many priests and clerics traveled from far to seek
knowledge and enlightenment. One of the head record keepers was great friends
with Martin's late father and and stayed very close with family even after his
friend's passing. Clarence was his name and it is he who inspired a great admiration
for the gods in Ralph. The elderly scholar would often tell Ralph about the great gods
and he quickly noticed Ralph's affinity for the gods of law and order. As time went on
and Ralph learned to read and write, Clarence begun to bring holy scripts, scholarly
text or even mundane legal documents as Ralph simply devoured everything and 
most especially things about law. A few years after the occurrence with the traveling
artificer, Clarence suggested to Ralph that he come study at the church and that day
fate moved the pick of Ralph device to point towards yes.

Ralph's time at the church was short. He was quite a bit older then most recruits 
and most importantly already knew to read and write. Very quickly he learned 
most of what the teacher-priests had to teach and none could satisfy his thirst 
for anything to do with law. Ralph adored the rigid structure of legislation and how
it left little to the whimsical decisions of one singular person. Yearning for more and
with significant help from Clarence, Ralph manged to get a position as a priestly 
scholar in the largest city in the northern plateau. But there he faced a bitter truth.
What he thought would be a utopian locus of law and society turned out to be a 
nightmare. People in power would often bend and twist to law and sometimes even
completely disregard it. There was poverty, starvation and mass misery all throughout
the town. Criminal syndicates basically run everything and had most officials on 
payroll, if the officials in question weren't the ones leading the syndicates in the first 
place. Ralph manged to survive there for 3 years. In the end, after objecting to the 
illegal actives of the syndicates one time too many, they turned their attention to him
and put him on The Blacklist. The Blacklist was a way of rooting out problematic 
individuals within the town. Everyone on it was almost instantly accused of several
high profile crimes and evidence proving their guild would appear seemingly of thin air. 
A high reward bounty followed.

Ralph stood on that hill for hours, his eyes wondered all around, his thoughts even more.
He asking himself countless questions and conceived dozen answers to each, yet he 
reached no explanation. Yes the government found out his birthplace, it was on multitude
of document. Yes they came to look for him here, it was obvious that's where he would go. 
Yes they interrogated and tortured the townsfolk, assuming that they hid him or at least 
knew of his whereabouts. Yes they searched and rampaged all houses, there might be 
hidden basements or floor holes. Yes failing to find anything they decided to complete 
the rest of the order to kill everyone and burn the village to make an example to everyone
who would dare defy the corrupt ruling class. It all seemed so clear and obvious now, but 
still completely explainable. Undefinable. Out of pure muscle memory, faced with the 
inability to make a verdict he pulled the lever of his device. It landed on "no", "no what" 
he asked out loud and pulled again. "no". He pulled once more. "no". For reasons that 
Ralph never manged to explain this calmed and relaxed him. Tears rolled down his face 
as he tried to hide it. He mumbled "I should've been here to defend them" and kept
wiping tears, but caught a slight glance at his wrist. The pick had moved towards "Yes".
After a minute he stood up, wiped the last drops off his cheeks and reached towards 
the tiny lever again, looked up to the skies and ask: "Where to now". As the pick 
was spinning he held his arm out strait and when he felt it stopped he looked 
and it pointed east. 

The next 4 years saw Ralph travel all around the continent and islands helping whoever
he met, however he could. He saw many wonderful and horrible things and defied the 
government everywhere he could. Throughout the long journey he met hundreds of people,
had had many companions, yet none of them where quite as intriguing as the ones he would 
meet at a little tavern today.
