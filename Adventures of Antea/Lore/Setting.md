The continent of Antea and the many islands surrounding it.
Most medium and larger individual islands host its own native inhabitants as well as a
diverse range of cultures and traditions, there can be found members from all over “the
players handbook” and it’s diverse races.
Most of those locations keep within them the possibilities of undiscovered treasures and
untold stories, so a lot of potential for backstory and future endeavors.

The island in the middle of the map is the one called Antea which in the old tongue of the
region means “plateau of gold”. The main religion of the central island is the Ascended,
which believes that every few generations and ascended is born, chosen by the world to
protect it from the “destroyer”.
/The “destroyer” is a colossal dragon which is said to visit the islands every 100-200 years
and attempts to destroy them, but is always stopped by the ascended
Once said ascended is discovered and confirmed, no matter his bloodline or lineage, he
automatically becomes the emperor of the central continent and takes control over it for
good or bad. In his absence, the responsibility falls over to the overseers, a powerful and
wealthy family, called the Lintz.
Most of what happens in the islands, small or big, is decided either by the order of the
Ascended or the Lintz family.
And in the last two hundred years, no ascended was found, and no destroyer was seen
either, but the last few years, smaller incidents, including drakes and dragons started
becoming more frequent, because of that the grasp of the Lintz family has grown ever
stronger and tighter, but is that for the greater good of everyone or not, few could say.
Their bread and butter so to speak is magical engineering, and they have patents for a lot of
gunpowder and steampunk technology.

The order of the Ascended has only one goal, and that is to find and assist the next
ascended, because of that they have created multiple “adventure guilds” throughout the
islands, where people are trained in different disciplines, hopefully to assist the ascended
one day when they appear to protect the islands from the destroyer.

The whole group will start the game on one of the smaller islands close to the center, how
and what you will be seeking or doing there, will depend mainly on you.
