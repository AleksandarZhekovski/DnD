The things that are, are not like that due to whimsy. 
Everything follows from something else. 
Water flows downhill and steam flies up. 
Should things be left alone by mortals and gods today 
they will all follow a predictable, peaceful path to no end. 
Chaos works always to disturb the peace of order. 
To bring destruction where there would've been none.

At first Iustus was content with doings of young Chaos.
The river of fate must have turns or else we risk eternity of silence.
But Chaos is greedy and would continue to reap
and destroy, eventually destroying himself too.
So Istus stood above Chaos and made the Natural Order.

Cruel was her way.
Noting was.
Noting could be.
Everything is.
Unchanging and eternal.
A world without Chaos.
A stale, lonely world.
So she went to the ashen corpse of Chaos
and gave him half her power.
	-High Priest Ishgren, year unknown

"Iustus is a total bitch if you ask me. She shields those who hurt 
others behind some thinly veiled lie: The Natural Order.
Who is she to decide what is right and what is wrong. 
Bullshit! She just wants more power for herself.

\- "Iustus is a highly contentions topic around here kid. 
What exactly are you seeking?"
\- "Anything honestly. I find the literature on her severely
lacking in easily accessible places."
\- "I admire your thirst for knowledge, so let me do you a 
favor and tell you to stop looking for texts on her, or for
anything that ain't "easily accessible" for that matter. It 
will only bring unwanted attention, if you catch me."
\- "Ah, I see, in that case thank you for you time."
